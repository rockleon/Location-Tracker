# Location-Tracker
Two simple android apps to track location.

The first app named 'locn' should be installed in android mobile of the person you want to track.
This app keeps sending location of that person, if and only if GPS and Data Connection in his mobile is on.

The second app named 'viewlocn' should be installed in your android mobile phone.
Open the app and you will get current location of all the mobiles having the first app installed.

These apps make use of FIREBASE as a cloud server, The first app saves the current location of users in server
and the second app fetches it. Too simple, not complicated at all.
